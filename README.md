# FOR ALL THE FOUR PROJECTS I MADE CODE BEGIN WITH USER NAME , THE WELCOME MESSAGE & THANK YOU NOTE, SO IT WILL GIVE YOU SOME POSITIVE FEEL

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project focuses on building a spam detection model using Machine Learning. The program trains a Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails.

# FEATURES & CONCEPTS USED IN THIS PROJECT

Data Preprocessing - Converting text into numerical format using CountVectorizer.

Supervised Learning - Implementing a classification model.

Train-Test Split - Splitting data for model evaluation.

Model Training - Using Naive Bayes for text classification.

Prediction - Classifying new messages as spam or not.

# LIBRARIES USED & IT PURPOSES

pandas: For handling tabular data.

sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer: Converts text data into numerical format.

sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split: Splits data into training and testing sets.

sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB: Implements the Naive Bayes classification model.

sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score: Measures model accuracy.
